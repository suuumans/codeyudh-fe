# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a competitive programming platform similar to LeetCode, designed to provide users with coding challenges, real-time code execution, and progress tracking. The platform consists of a frontend application built with React, TanStack Router, and either Shadcn/UI or DaisyUI for component styling, integrated with a backend server for data management, authentication, and code execution services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and manage my profile, so that I can track my progress and maintain my coding history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the platform THEN the frontend SHALL provide registration functionality with email and password validation
2. WHEN a user attempts to log in with valid credentials THEN the backend SHALL authenticate them and the frontend SHALL redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the frontend SHALL display their profile information fetched from the backend including username, solved problems count, and skill level
4. IF a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide password reset functionality via email through the backend service
5. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the frontend SHALL send updates to the backend and display confirmation upon successful save
6. WHEN a user session expires THEN the frontend SHALL automatically redirect to login and clear stored authentication tokens

### Requirement 2: Problem Catalog and Browsing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and filter coding problems, so that I can find challenges appropriate to my skill level and interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the problems page THEN the frontend SHALL fetch and display a list of coding problems from the backend with title, difficulty, and acceptance rate
2. WHEN a user applies filters (difficulty, topic, status) THEN the frontend SHALL send filter parameters to the backend and update the problem list accordingly
3. WHEN a user searches for problems THEN the frontend SHALL send search queries to the backend and display relevant results based on title and description
4. WHEN a user clicks on a problem THEN the frontend SHALL navigate to the problem detail page and fetch problem details from the backend
5. IF a user has solved a problem THEN the backend SHALL track this status and the frontend SHALL mark it as completed in the list
6. WHEN the problems list loads THEN the backend SHALL return paginated results to optimize performance

### Requirement 3: Code Editor and Problem Solving Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to write and test code solutions in an integrated editor, so that I can solve problems efficiently within the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a problem THEN the frontend SHALL fetch and display the problem description, constraints, and examples from the backend
2. WHEN a user selects a programming language THEN the frontend SHALL provide a code editor with syntax highlighting for that language
3. WHEN a user writes code THEN the frontend SHALL provide real-time syntax validation and error highlighting
4. WHEN a user runs their code THEN the frontend SHALL send the code to the backend execution service and display results
5. WHEN a user submits their solution THEN the frontend SHALL send the code to the backend which SHALL run it against all test cases and return feedback
6. IF the solution passes all tests THEN the backend SHALL mark the problem as solved and update user statistics, and the frontend SHALL reflect these changes
7. WHEN code is being executed THEN the frontend SHALL display loading states and the backend SHALL enforce execution timeouts

### Requirement 4: Test Case Execution and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my code against various test cases, so that I can verify my solution works correctly before submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs code THEN the backend execution service SHALL run it against visible sample test cases within 5 seconds and return results to the frontend
2. WHEN a user submits code THEN the backend SHALL execute it against all hidden test cases in a secure environment and return pass/fail status
3. IF code execution times out THEN the backend SHALL terminate execution and the frontend SHALL display a timeout error message
4. IF code produces runtime errors THEN the backend SHALL capture error details and the frontend SHALL display them with line numbers
5. WHEN test cases pass THEN the backend SHALL calculate execution time and memory usage, and the frontend SHALL display these statistics
6. WHEN code is executed THEN the backend SHALL ensure secure sandboxed execution to prevent malicious code from affecting the system

### Requirement 5: Progress Tracking and Statistics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my coding progress and statistics, so that I can track my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the frontend SHALL fetch and display user statistics from the backend including solved problems count, success rate, and recent activity
2. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the frontend SHALL display data from the backend showing problem-solving streaks and difficulty distribution
3. WHEN a user completes a problem THEN the backend SHALL update their statistics and the frontend SHALL reflect changes in real-time
4. WHEN a user views problem history THEN the frontend SHALL fetch and display all attempted problems with submission status from the backend
5. IF a user maintains a solving streak THEN the backend SHALL track streak data and the frontend SHALL highlight and celebrate the achievement
6. WHEN statistics are calculated THEN the backend SHALL aggregate user data efficiently and cache frequently accessed metrics

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the platform on any device with an optimized experience, so that I can practice coding anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN a user accesses the platform on tablet THEN the system SHALL adapt the code editor for comfortable coding
3. WHEN a user accesses the platform on desktop THEN the system SHALL utilize the full screen space efficiently
4. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide accessible focus management
5. IF a user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL support screen readers and high contrast modes

### Requirement 7: Modern UI Components and Theming

**User Story:** As a user, I want an attractive and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on solving problems without UI distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the platform THEN the frontend SHALL provide consistent styling using Shadcn/UI or DaisyUI components
2. WHEN a user switches between light and dark themes THEN the frontend SHALL apply the theme consistently across all pages and persist the preference
3. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the frontend SHALL provide appropriate loading states while communicating with the backend
4. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the frontend SHALL display user-friendly error messages based on backend error responses with clear next steps
5. IF a user navigates between pages THEN the frontend SHALL provide smooth transitions using TanStack Router and maintain application state appropriately

### Requirement 8: API Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured API integration between frontend and backend, so that data flows efficiently and securely throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN it SHALL communicate with the backend through RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the frontend SHALL include proper authentication headers and the backend SHALL validate them
3. WHEN data is transmitted THEN both frontend and backend SHALL use consistent data formats and validation schemas
4. IF API requests fail THEN the frontend SHALL implement retry logic and graceful error handling
5. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the backend SHALL implement proper authorization checks before processing requests
6. WHEN the application loads THEN the frontend SHALL efficiently manage API calls to minimize backend load and improve user experience
